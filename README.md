# my-portfolio
This repository showcases my personal web development portfolio, including a collection of projects I've built to demonstrate my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. Each project highlights different aspects of my growth as a developer â€” from responsive design to working with APIs and frameworks.
